WillowMath
==========

The math library for the Willow game engine, a little incomplete (lacking SIMD for one thing) but for I'll add that once it becomes necessary. For now it has all the math functions you need to get a simple OpenGL renderer up and running, and a friendly source for modification and addition as needed.

All I ask is that if you notice a bug or have a good idea for an improvement, you tell me. You don't HAVE to, (it is public domain after all) but that would make you an awesome person.
